Great job! 

Having successfully logged in with the credentials from Level 1, your next challenge is to perform information gathering from within Jennaâ€™s account. 

You will need to explore Jenna's home profile, search through posts, and examine comments to locate the user who has posted the flag. This level emphasizes your ability to navigate a web application and retrieve useful information hidden within user interactions.

The flag will be a comment in the post of the encrypted message for level 3.

__Please make sure to note down the encrypted message somewhere as it will not be available in level 3.__
