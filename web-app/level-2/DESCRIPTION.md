Great job! 

Having successfully logged in with the credentials from Level 1, your next challenge is to perform information gathering from within Jenna’s account. 

You will need to explore Jenna's home profile, search through posts, and examine comments to locate the user who has posted the flag. This level emphasizes your ability to navigate a web application and retrieve useful information hidden within user interactions.

The flag will be a comment in a post about the encrypted messages.
