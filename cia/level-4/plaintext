I, THE LEADER OF THE BLACK DAWN, HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT MISSION FOR YOU — ONE THAT IS GOING TO SHAKE THE SYSTEMS OF THE CITY OF MEGALOPOLIS! WE PLAN TO CREATE A BIT OF DIGITAL MISCHIEF, AND WITH YOUR HELP, THEIR CITY WILL DEFINITELY NOTICE IT. FIRST, THERE IS THE MATTER OF THE CITY'S POWER GRID. THIER GRID IS LOCATED AT 12345 N. POWER STATION WAY. THE PASSCODE TO GET PAST THEIR SECURITY GATE IS QYDKSGR. IF WE CONTROL THE ELECTRICITY, WE CAN PLAY A FEW HARMLESS TRICKS WITH THEIR SYSTEMS — TRICKS THAT WILL SURELY BE VERY FUNNY FOR US. NEXT, WE LOOK TO THE MEGALOPOLIS CENTRAL BANK — NOT TO TAKE MONEY, BUT TO TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THEIR HIDDEN DATA FILES. IT IS LOCATED ON 654321 W. MONEY DRIVE. WHAT’S HIDDEN IN THERE MIGHT HELP US CONFUSE THINGS EVEN MORE — AND THAT IS GOOD FOR OUR PLAN! LASTLY, WE WILL VISIT THE MEGALOPOLIS COURTHOUSE. IT IS FOUND AT 78910 N. CENTRAL AVENUE. IT IS THERE THAT WE’LL SEND OUR FINAL MESSAGE — A HARMLESS PRANK THAT WILL SHOW JUST HOW CLEVER WE ARE WITH OUR IDEAS. THIS IS YOUR CHALLENGE: CRACK THE CODES, TRACK THE SIGNALS, AND STOP US IF YOU CAN. ONLY WITH A STRONG TEAM, A LOT OF WILL, AND THE COURAGE TO DO IT CAN YOU DEFEND THE CITY. LET’S SEE IF YOU HAVE GOT WHAT IT TAKES!
