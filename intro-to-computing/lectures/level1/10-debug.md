# Debugging

So how do we know our `mov` instruction correctly set RAX to {{ target_rax }}? At the heart of this question lies the science and art of debugging. Writing programs is easy--writing programs that work correctly is much harder! Most of your time as a programmer will be spent debugging.

If you are ever confused about what your program is doing, what you need to think is "I will debug this". You should want to feel your program live and breathe. To understand it. To empathize with it.

You will be debugging for the rest of your life. Get used to it now.

Say it now. Say it loud and proud: "I will debug this!"
